  <p>Octopod is taking Friday, June 16, 2023 off to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/">Satisfactory</a>! If you have a moderately capable Windows gaming PC, come build conveyer belt spaghetti with us, starting at 9 am ET and ending whenever we get bored. (Our dedicated server will continue running indefinitely, though, so you can keep playing or come back later even after everyone else has left.)</p>

  <h2>How to join</h2>

  <p>First, you'll need a copy of Satisfactory. It's available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory">Epic Games Store</a>. If you don't already own it, send Ross your Steam Friend Code (which you can find in <kbd>Steam</kbd> > <kbd>Settings</kbd> > <kbd>Account</kbd>), and the ‚ú® Magical Octopod Legitimate Business Expense Fairy üßö will gift you a copy!</p>

  <p>‚ö†Ô∏è We're playing the <strong>pre-release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/3690183765419759383">Update 8</a>,</strong> which means you'll need to switch to the Experimental branch. If you own the game on Steam, right-click on Satisfactory in your library, select <kbd>Properties</kbd> > <kbd>Betas</kbd>, and opt into "Experimental" in the "Beta Participation" dropdown menu. In the Epic Games Launcher, the Experimental branch should appear in your library as a separate game. Update 8 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/3690183765419759383">many exciting new features</a>, but expect some bugs and less-than-optimal performance (although Coffee Stain Studios has already released two bug fix and performance patches since the initial pre-release on Tuesday).</p>

  <p>Once you have the Experimental branch installed, joining the server is easy:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>From the game's main menu, click on <kbd>Server Manager</kbd> > <kbd>Add Server</kbd>.</li>
    <li>Fill in <code>satisfactory.octopod.ink</code> as the server address, and the default port of <code>15777</code>. Click <kbd>Confirm</kbd>.</li>
    <li>‚ÄúGo Pound‚Äù will appear in your server list. Click <kbd>Join Game</kbd> to join the session!</li>
  </ol>

  <p>We're using all of the default gameplay settings, except that creature hostility is set to ‚Äúretaliate‚Äù, which means nothing will attack you unless you attack first. Of course, environmental effects like noxious gas, radioactivity and fall damage will still cause ouchies.</p>

  <h2>Voice chat</h2>

  <p>We'll use Kurt's unofficial <a href="https://discord.gg/yEJkMKT"><strike>Go Pound</strike> Grubhub Discord server</a> for voice chat. Join whatever voice channel you see people in.</p>
